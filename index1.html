The processor acts as the brain of the computer, while RAM ensures smooth multitasking and fast performance.

With the help of an operating system like Windows, Linux, or macOS, a PC allows users to install and run various software applications according to their needs. Modern PCs are highly customizable, enabling users to upgrade components to improve performance for tasks like gaming, software development, graphic designing, and data analysis.

Overall, a PC is a powerful and essential tool that enhances productivity, learning, and entertainment in today’s digital world.
